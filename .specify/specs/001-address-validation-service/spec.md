# Feature Specification: Address Validation Service (001)

## Overview
Implement a robust address validation service that acts as an Anti-Corruption Layer over third-party providers, providing a clean API for validating US addresses without building the validation logic internally.

## User Stories

### User Story 1: Validate Address
As a client application developer, I want to POST an address string to /api/v1/validate-address and receive a standardized, validated address response, so that I can ensure user-provided addresses are accurate and deliverable.

### User Story 2: Handle Invalid Addresses
As a client application, I want to receive clear status codes and responses for unverifiable addresses, so that I can handle errors gracefully and prompt users for corrections.

### User Story 3: Cached Validation
As a system administrator, I want the service to cache validation results to reduce costs and improve performance, so that repeated validations of the same address are fast and inexpensive.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- **Endpoint**: POST /api/v1/validate-address
- **Input**: JSON body with required field `address` (string)
- **Output**: JSON response with status, inputAddress, standardizedAddress (or null), zipCode, zipPlus4
- **Statuses**: valid, corrected, unverifiable
- **Caching**: Redis cache-aside with 30-90 day TTL
- **Provider**: SmartyStreets for CASS-certified validation
- **Framework**: NestJS with TypeScript

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Sub-second response times for cached addresses
- **Reliability**: Circuit breaker pattern for provider failures (503 response)
- **Security**: Rate limiting and authentication
- **Observability**: Structured logging and health checks
- **Compliance**: Handle address data privacy appropriately

## Technical Constraints
- Use locked technology stack: NestJS, Redis, Docker, TypeScript
- Follow Test-First development
- Implement .http files for API documentation and testing
- Comments focus on "why" and business rules only

## Edge Cases
- Ambiguous addresses (select first highest confidence candidate)
- Provider downtime (return 503)
- Invalid input (400 response)
- Rate limiting triggered (429 response)

## Test Scenarios
- Valid address validation
- Corrected address (typos, missing ZIP)
- Unverifiable address
- Provider failure simulation
- Caching behavior
- Rate limiting

## Dependencies
- SmartyStreets API access
- Redis instance
- Docker environment

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Provider Cost**: Mitigated by aggressive caching
- **Data Freshness**: 30-day TTL balance performance vs accuracy
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Abstracted via interface for easy provider swap

## Success Metrics
- 99.9% uptime
- <1s response time for cached requests
- >95% cache hit rate
- <1% unverifiable addresses processed
