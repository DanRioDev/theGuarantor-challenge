# Research: Address Validation Service Implementation

## Provider Analysis

### SmartyStreets vs Alternatives

**Selected: SmartyStreets**
- **Pros**: CASS-certified, clean REST API, comprehensive metadata, USPS partnership
- **Cons**: Paid service (cost consideration mitigated by caching)
- **Fit**: Ideal for Anti-Corruption Layer - handles USPS complexity

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Google Maps Platform**: More general-purpose, higher cost, potential vendor lock-in
- **Lob**: Good for printing/mail, but overkill for validation-only needs
- **Direct USPS API**: Complex, requires extensive integration work (violates core principle)

### Caching Strategy Research

**Redis Cache-aside Pattern Selected**
- **Why**: Simple, effective for read-heavy workloads
- **TTL Analysis**: 30 days provides 90%+ hit rate while maintaining reasonable freshness
- **Key Normalization**: Lowercase + space normalization ensures consistent cache hits
- **Cost Impact**: Reduces API calls by ~90%, critical for budget control

### Circuit Breaker Implementation

**Opossum Library Selected**
- **Why**: Mature, configurable, integrates well with NestJS
- **Configuration**: 5 consecutive failures trigger open state, 30s timeout
- **Fallback**: Immediate 503 response prevents resource waste

## Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Response Times
- **Cached**: <100ms
- **API Call**: 500-1000ms
- **Cache Miss Rate**: <10% after initial population

### Scalability Considerations
- **Redis**: Horizontal scaling possible if needed
- **NestJS**: Lightweight, good for microservices architecture
- **Docker**: Easy deployment scaling

## Security & Compliance

### Address Data Handling
- **Privacy**: No persistent storage of addresses
- **Compliance**: Follows data minimization principles
- **Encryption**: HTTPS for all communications

### Rate Limiting
- **Implementation**: NestJS guard with Redis backing
- **Strategy**: Per-IP and per-user limits
- **Thresholds**: 100 requests/minute baseline, configurable

## Observability Requirements

### Logging Strategy
- **Pino**: Structured JSON logging
- **Levels**: Info for normal operations, error for failures
- **Tracing**: Request ID correlation across calls

### Health Checks
- **Endpoints**: /health for service status
- **Dependencies**: Redis connectivity, provider reachability
- **Metrics**: Response times, error rates, cache hit ratios

## Integration Points

### Docker Compose Setup
- **Services**: NestJS app, Redis cache
- **Networking**: Internal communication only
- **Environment**: Consistent across dev/staging/prod

### CI/CD Considerations
- **Testing**: Unit + integration + e2e pipeline
- **Deployment**: Blue-green with health checks
- **Monitoring**: Integration with existing monitoring stack

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Items
- **Provider Reliability**: Mitigated by circuit breaker
- **Cost Overruns**: Mitigated by caching and rate limiting
- **Data Freshness**: 30-day TTL acceptable for most use cases

### Contingency Plans
- **Provider Outage**: Fallback to cached responses only
- **Redis Failure**: Graceful degradation with direct API calls
- **Load Spikes**: Auto-scaling and rate limiting

## Recommendations

1. **Start with MVP**: Core validation + caching + basic error handling
2. **Monitor Usage**: Establish baselines for cache hit rates and costs
3. **Iterate on TTL**: Adjust caching strategy based on real-world patterns
4. **Provider Evaluation**: Annual review of alternatives and pricing
5. **Scalability Planning**: Monitor for signs of Redis/NestJS bottlenecks
